This is make.info, produced by makeinfo version 4.13 from make.texi.

This file documents the GNU `make' utility, which determines
automatically which pieces of a large program need to be recompiled,
and issues the commands to recompile them.

   This is Edition 0.72, last updated 24 October 2013, of `The GNU Make
Manual', for GNU `make' version 4.0.
