Help Authoring Extension

This extension adds a new menu to the Writer's menubar, and allows easy
editing of the LibreOffice Help.  Usage info is here:

== Hacking it ==

If you want to improve the extension itself, get the sources here:

  $ git clone git://anongit.freedesktop.org/libreoffice/contrib/dev-tools dev-tools

and start hacking it.  Most probably you'll want to do improvements to the
.xhp export filter:

  helpauthoring/filter/soffice2xmlhelp.xsl

To do that the most effectively, choose a reasonably complicated .xhp file,
like:

  help/source/text/schart/01/type_stock.xhp

if you did an independent
git clone git://gerrit.libreoffice.org/help
as suggested in https://wiki.documentfoundation.org/Documentation/Help

or if you are in the developers' work tree with submodules

  helpcontent2/source/text/schart/01/type_stock.xhp

convert it to .fodt (Save As... in Writer), and then use:

  xsltproc helpauthoring/filter/soffice2xmlhelp.xsl help/source/text/schart/01/type_stock.fodt > out

When you are happy with the improved output in 'out', commit & push the
improved soffice2xmlhelp.xsl via gerrit.

== Releasing it ==

Increase the version number both in:

  helpauthoring/HelpAuthoring/_Main.xba
  helpauthoring/description.xml

and then:

  cd helpauthoring && make dist

The new version will be created in the helpauthoring/ directory.

Upload it to:

  http://dev-www.libreoffice.org/helpauthoring/

and announce.
