Produces a csv list of pings per country from the Update pings.


1. Ensure you have the GeoLite Country Database, "GeoIP.dat", and place
   it in the script folder:

   http://dev.maxmind.com/geoip/legacy/geolite/

2. Place the stats data in data/ (relative to the script folder)

3. Run compiler.py -- this can take a few hours, and places it's temporary data
   in storage-country-months/

4. Run analyser.py (is fast)

If you have updated the ping data in data/, re-running compiler.py should take
much less time as it reuses the previously parsed data (although this isn't
fully tested yet).

To count unique IPs per month rather than update pings, for a quick hack solution
it would probably be sufficient to replace line 117:
ipHits[sReadableVersion][sIP] = ipHits.get(sReadableVersion, {}).get(sIP,0) + 1
with
ipHits[sReadableVersion][sIP] = 1
