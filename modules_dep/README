modules_dep is a program to analyzed the dependencies of libreoffice's modules

options:
-u print a moduel only once
-c <foo> list the child modules of foo. the 'child' dependent are the module that need <foo> to build before them
-p <foo> list the parent modules of foo. the parent modules are the modules that need to be built before <foo>

the arguments must be the list of all the build.lst to analyze.

example:
find $(SRC_ROOT) -maxdepth 5 -name "build.lst" | grep -v "splitbuild/" | xargs ./a.out -u -c svx 

Note: optional dependecies are considered always required except SUN:xxx which are ignored.
